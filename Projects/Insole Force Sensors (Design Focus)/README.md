# Insole Force Sensor Design Prompt
As the field of robotics, exoskeletons, and prosthetics grows, accurate ground force sensing becomes increasingly important. To better control and calibrate exoskeletons and prosthetic limbs, having accurate measurements of the force exerted on the ground is essential. The goal of this project is to improve upon current insole ground-force sensing technology with innovative application of hardware and/or software. Currently, most insole force sensors are expensive, not durable, and prone to hysteresis. **This challenge asks you to use hardware and/or software solutions to build a better sensor system that can be used to monitor and analyse gait cycles.**

## Baseline objective: 
Implement a system that can detect each phase of the gait cycle. The sensors should be able to fit within a shoe.

## Intermediate objective:
Design a system that can give accurate force measurements through the various phases of a gait cycle. The sensor should fit within a shoe.

## Advanced objective:
Create an insole sensor that can make accurate normal and/or **shear** force measurements through a gait cycle. The sensor should fit within a shoe.
